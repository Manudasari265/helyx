# Helyx

## A Solana based Blockchain Indexing Platform on Helius

### Core Functionality
-> Postgres Database Integration:

* Users should be able to sign up and provide their Postgres database credentials.

* The platform should allow users to specify what they want to index on the Solana blockchain.

-> Customizable Data Indexing:

* Users can choose from predefined indexing categories, such as:

* Currently available bids on an NFT

* Current prices of an NFT

* Currently available tokens to borrow

* The current price of a specific token on various platforms

* The platform should automatically start filling the userâ€™s Postgres database with the selected data.

-> Automated Blockchain Data Retrieval:

* Uses Helius webhooks to facilitate data indexing.

* Removes the need for users to manage their own RPCs or Validators.

* Ensures real-time and accurate data synchronization with Solana blockchain.

-> User-Friendly Interface & Experience:

* A simple and intuitive interface where users can provide their Postgres credentials and select data indexing options.

* Automated backend process to handle data retrieval and indexing without manual intervention.

* Clear status updates and logs for data synchronization progress.

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
